##Source Code layout
###Folder Layout
- src : Source code for the webserver
 - Server : Runs the server and accepts connections
 - Connection : Handles connection-related events (reading and writing)
 - ConfigHandler : Encapsulates config parsing and access to config options
 - ConfigParser : Parses the config
 - Request and Response : Classes that represent parsed requests and responses
 - RequestHandler : Parent to the webserver handlers that defines shared functionality
 - EchoHandler : Echo handling
 - StaticFileHandler : Static file handling
 - ProxyHandler: Handle requests to a remote host by proxy
- test : Contains tests for each class
- build : build files

###Connection Class
- Bulk of interaction with other classes occurs here
- Connection::handle_read calls Request::parse to parse a request
- Connection::handle_read will call the error handlers if the request cannot be parsed or if the requested file is not found
- Connection::ProcessRequest will call the correct handler, if the request is valid and attempts to access a file that is present


###RequestHandlers
- EchoHandler : Echo client request.
- StaticFileHandler : Return static file to client.
- StatusHandler : Show the webserver status including details of request received and service provide.
- ErrorHandler : Handle different HTTP errors and show details.
- ProxyHandler : Open a new connection to a remote host and handle requests using new connection.
